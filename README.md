This repository contains the code used for the implementation of the dependency of evaporation on temperature into a Simple Water Balance Model for the course "Earth System Modelling" in 2025/2026 at the University of Freiburg.

"Implementation.ipynb" contains the implementation of the temperature dependency of evaporation and the calibrations of the new and old model for three different sites.
"ESM_Output_Analysis.ipynb" contains the analysis of the calibrated model output for both models and all three sites. In Detail it contains the analysis of the seasonal correlations as well als the figures.
